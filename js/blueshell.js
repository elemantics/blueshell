 * Name: blueshell.js
 * Author: John Newman
 * Date: 7-18-12
 * Version: 2.1
 * License: MIT
 * URL: https://github.com/jgnewman/blueshell
 * Description: A JS microlibrary for inheritance.  Geared more toward seamless integration with prototypes. Even works in IE.
 *
 * Version 2 contains:
 *   - No more BS joke :)
 *   - Less looping
 *   - "Infinitely" chainable prototypes that are super easy to make
 *   - A simpler, stricter interface
 *   - Prototypes accessible in EVERY JS environment including old versions of IE
 *   - The .hatch method has been renamed .create
 *
 * Usage:
 * Any time you create an object, do it with BlueShell.create:
 *
 *   var person = B.create({name: 'john', age: 28})
 *
 * If you ignore the previous rule, you will not get seamless prototypes that work
 * in a cross-browser capacity.
 *
 * Any time you want to extend an object, also do it with BlueShell.create:
 *
 *   var kid = B.create(parent, B.create({name: 'bill', eyes: 'brown'}))
 *
 * A second argument will contain mixins and overrides.
 *
 * Any time you want to create a new object bound to a prototype, do it with BlueShell.bindProto:
 *
 *   var parent = B.create({
 *       "getName" : function () {return this.name;}
 *       "getAge"  : function () {return this.age;}
 *   });
 *   var kid = B.bindProto(parent, B.create({name: 'john', age: 28}));
 *
 * Objects created with BlueShell.bindProto undergo the same special treatment as objects created
 * with BlueShell.create so they can be used in all the same ways, including as prototypes
 * for other new objects.
 *
 * All prototypes attached with BlueShell can be retrieved in any JS environment.  Each Object
 * created with BlueShell has access to a prototypal "getProto" function that returns its
 * prototype:
 *
 * myObject.getProto();
 * => {...whatever the prototype is...}

   * Step 1: Generate a new date in milliseconds
   * Step 2: Add an incrementor
   * Step 3: Add 25 random chars
   * Philosophy: Generating the date means we only have to worry about ids converging when
   *             those ids are created during the same millisecond.  The incrementor ranges
   *             from 1000000 to 9999999 so there is virtually no way that this many ids will
   *             be created in the same millisecond.  But if somehow they are or if a bad JS
   *             implementation somehow calls the function twice at the exact same moment and
   *             glitches out on the incrementor, we rely on a random 25 character string.
